# Blog-2.0
This is the other blog but with actual authentication so it's pretty much the peak of all of what i have learned.
It took me some time to finish this project, and i do know that the project itself really isn't the best *ahem*bad*ahem*, but im actually proud of it, as i learned new things in the making.
I found a lot of obstacles, and not all of them were fixed properly, so some feedback would be appreciated.
Last thing i want to say is that there would be a Blog-3.0 in the future, which will contain the "V" in MVC and actual error messages. So i hope you stay tuned for more :D
